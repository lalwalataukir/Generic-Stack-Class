# Generic Stack Class
* Implemented generic Stack Class using growable arrays
* Stack support push operation with amortized time complexity of O(1)
* Also implemented pop, top and isEmpty functions with O(1) time complexity
* toString function can be used to return Stack elements from top to bottom as a String

# Postfix Evaluator
* Used generic Stack Class for evaluating postfix expressions
* Evaluated postfix expression in O(|input string|) time complexity
