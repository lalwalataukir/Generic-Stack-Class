# Generic Stack Class
* Implemented generic Stack Class using growable arrays
* Stack support push operation with amortized time complexity of O(1)
* Also implemented pop, top and isEmpty functions with O(1) time complexity
* toString function can be used to return Stack elements from top to bottom as a String

# Postfix Evaluator
* Used generic Stack Class for evaluating postfix expressions
* Evaluated postfix expression in O(|input string|) time complexity

# Running code
* stackTestCases.txt contained test cases for generic Stack Class, stackOut.txt contains expected outputs
* postFixTestCases.txt contained test cases for generic Stack Class, postFixOut.txt contains expected outputs
* For evaluating on new test cases, add the new test case in stackTestCases.txt/postFixTestCases.txt files and corresponding expected output in stackOut.txt/postFixOut.txt file respectively
* For compiling use ```javac StackInterface.java MyStack.java Calculator.java Main.java``` and for running use ```java Main``` in the terminal
